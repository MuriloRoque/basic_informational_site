# Basic Informational Site

This is a very basic informational site that contains 4 pages: index, about, contact-me and 404. Implemented using Node.js

In this project I:

- Created 4 basic HTML pages;
- Implemented a Node.js server to access the pages.

# What it does?

- When the server is initialized:

  - You can access `localhost:8080` to get to the main page;
  - You can access `localhost:8080/about` to get to the about page;
  - You can access `localhost:8080/contact-me` to get to the contact page;
  - If you type the wrong address, an error page will load.

## Built with

- HTML
- Node.js

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository on your local machine;
- Cd into the folder;
- Run `node index.js`;
- Open your browser and type `localhost:8080`;.
